This section covers the Divide and Conquer strategy, a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems.

Definition and Strategy: Explained the divide and conquer approach, which involves dividing a problem into smaller parts, conquering each part independently, and combining their results.

Key Phases: Outlined the three main phases: Divide (split the problem), Conquer (solve the subproblems), and Combine (merge the results).

Common Algorithms: Discussed popular algorithms that utilize this technique, such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search, highlighting their efficiencies.

Advantages: Emphasized the benefits of the divide and conquer strategy, including reduced complexity and improved performance for large datasets.

Real-World Applications: Provided examples of real-world applications, such as processing large files, computational geometry, and parallel processing.
